Got a bus 41 or fewer bits wide?

Stierlitz will sit on your bus and imitate a USB Mass Storage device.  The latter will appear to have a FAT16 file system on it, containing a single binary "image" file.

Mount it (under Linux, using "mount -o sync ...") and perform arbitrary reads/writes by reading or writing blocks within the image file.
