Got a bus 31 or fewer bits wide?

Stierlitz will sit on your bus and imitate a USB Mass Storage device.  The latter will appear to have a FAT16 file system on it, containing a single binary "image" file.

Mount it (under Linux, using "mount -o sync ...") and perform arbitrary reads/writes by reading or writing blocks within the image file.

Make sure to use the O_DIRECT flag (or "raw" block device, if your kernel still has it) to disable ALL caching on the PC end.

If you snip out the FAT16 emulation, you can get 41 bits of address space.
